`BitsX` provides types and functions for manipulating bits in objects representing binary numbers: strings, integers,
arrays, tuples, etc.

Parts of `BitsX` are similar to, and derived from, [`Bits.jl`](https://github.com/rfourquet/Bits.jl).
Some bugs are fixed (I think there were some bugs fixed there in since I wrote this) and some design choices are different.
The scope of `BitsX` is wider.
